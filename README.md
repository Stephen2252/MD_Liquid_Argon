# A Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Liquid Argon

The simulation used Lennard-Jones potential. 

Detailed information can be found in [A. Rahman, "Correlations in the Motion of Atoms in Liquid Argon", Physical Review, 1964].

The solidification temperature can be calculated by decreasing the temperature and monitoring the diffusion coefficient.
